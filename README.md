# nameChanger
The name changer is a program that removes spaces, underscores and dashes from file names, or replaces them with other characters. It modifies file names in any directory of your choice, and can recursively rename files in subdirectories as well. The program is written using the Tkinter library on Python 3.

##Issues
* None of the features have been exhaustively tested.
* As of now, the code structure is very messy; all code is in one file and function definitions are in the middle of the file.
* The "undo" feature only reliably works to revert one change at a time.
* The UI layout wastes a lot of window space.
